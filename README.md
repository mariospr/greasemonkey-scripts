# My particular homegrown collection of GreaseMonkey scripts

## 1. phabricator-expand-older-comments.js

A GreaseMonkey script to always expand older comments in Phabricator

This script will wait for a task to load and then will simulate a mouse
click on the "Show Older Comments" link, to never keep them hidden.
